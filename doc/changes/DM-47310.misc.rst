Modified ``time_this`` so that exceptions occurring within the timer no longer change the log level to ``ERROR``.
Instead the log level remains unchanged but the exception information is included in the log message.
This allows the viewer to see why the timing might be different but also prevents log messages appearing when some code higher up caught the exception and continued on.
