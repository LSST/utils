Adds an alternative way of interacting with ``calculate_safe_plotting_limits()``.

This change adds a factory interface, such that one can use the function to accumulate the safe plotting limits over many different data series without having them all in-hand, by using the ``make_calculate_safe_plotting_limits()`` function to return a ``calculate_safe_plotting_limits()`` which will return the common limits after the addition of each new data series. The original behaviour remains unchanged.
