def get_caller_name(skip=2):
    """Get the name of the caller as a string in the form module.class.method

    Any item that cannot be determined (or is not relevant, e.g. a free
    function function has no class) is silently omitted, along with an
    associated separator. An empty string is returned if `skip` exceeds the
    stack height.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skip : int
        How many levels of stack to skip while getting caller name;
        1 means "who calls me", 2 means "who calls my caller", etc.

    Adapted from from http://stackoverflow.com/a/9812105
    by adding support to get the class from parentframe.f_locals['cls']
