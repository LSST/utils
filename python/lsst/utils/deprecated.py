def deprecate_pybind11(obj, reason, category=FutureWarning):
    """Deprecate a pybind11-wrapped C++ interface function, method or class.

    This needs to use a pass-through Python wrapper so that
    `~deprecated.sphinx.deprecated` can update its docstring; pybind11
    docstrings are native and cannot be modified.

    Note that this is not a decorator; its output must be assigned to
    replace the method being deprecated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : function, method, or class
        The function, method, or class to deprecate.
    reason : `str`
        Reason for deprecation, passed to `~deprecated.sphinx.deprecated`
    category : `Warning`
        Warning category, passed to `~deprecated.sphinx.deprecated`

    Returns
    -------
    obj : function, method, or class
        Wrapped function, method, or class

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

       ExposureF.getCalib = deprecate_pybind11(ExposureF.getCalib,
               reason="Replaced by getPhotoCalib. (Will be removed in 18.0)",

def suppress_deprecations(category=FutureWarning):
    """Suppress warnings generated by `deprecated.sphinx.deprecated`.

    Naively, one might attempt to suppress these warnings by using
    `~warnings.catch_warnings`. However, `~deprecated.sphinx.deprecated`
    attempts to install its own filter, overriding that. This convenience
    method works around this and properly suppresses the warnings by providing
    a mock `~warnings.simplefilter` for `~deprecated.sphinx.deprecated` to
    call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    category : `Warning` or subclass
        The category of warning to suppress.
